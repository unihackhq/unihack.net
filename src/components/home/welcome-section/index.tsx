      <div className={styles.centerText}>
        <p>
          Join 500+ students for a 48-hour hybrid hackathon weekend where you
          get to learn new skills, connect with brilliant mentors, forge new
          friendships with like-minded students, and build something incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone is welcome at UNIHACK, whether you are just getting started
          or a seasoned hacker. All you need is to be passionate about building
          stuff.

          <p>
            <strong>Officially, we do not have a theme or prompt.</strong> You
            can build whatever you want, in whatever shape that you want - a
            mobile app, a hardware piece, or even a video game. Every idea is
            eligible for the Main Prize.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of our prizes (TBD) do have specific challenges or themes, and
            we strongly encourage you to use them to shape your idea.
