                What does the project look like? Is it intuitive, aesthetically
                pleasing, and accessible? And most importantly, does it actually
                work?

                Does the hack look technically interesting or challenging? Is it
                simply putting a pretty frontend on an existing API or does it
                do something more?

                How unique is the hack? Does it solve a new problem, or have a
                new take on an existing problem?

                Does it spark joy? Would this be something you use and show to
                your friends? Yes, this is totally subjective. But thatâ€™s what
                makes it fun.
