    <p>
      We are Australiaâ€™s largest student hackathon.
      We bring together a diverse range of students to collaborate and bring innovative ideas to life
      - fostering the next generation of developers, thinkers, and entrepreneurs.

    <p>
      In a team of 4-6, build your idea (an app, website, device or anything really!), pitch it, and win prizes.
      We will provide you with the mentors, workshops, and plenty of food and drinks to keep you going!
