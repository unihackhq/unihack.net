## Participation FAQs

### Who can compete at UNIHACK?

UNIHACK is open to all university and TAFE students in Australia and New Zealand
who are 18 years and older.

You must be an enrolled student on the date that UNIHACK starts. If you have
completed your studies but have not had your graduation ceremony yet,
**you are still eligible** to compete at UNIHACK.

We reserve the right to terminate your participation if you do not meet this
requirement.

### How many people can be in a team?

Teams must have between four and six people.

### I don't have a team for UNIHACK?

Don't worry, we have that covered. Simply join the UNIHACK Discord and post a
message in #team-finder channel.

- If you're looking for a team, mention your interests and skills!

- If you're looking to fill up your team, mention what you're looking for.

### I have never been to a hackathon, is that okay?

Certainly! Hackathons are a great way to learn new skills, and there will be
mentors available to help you along the way to help you build the best possible
idea during the event.

### Do you do travel reimbursements?

We do not provide travel reimbursements. Our event is also a virtual event, so you
will not be required to travel to compete for the event.

### Where can I find the rules?

[You can find the rules on our website][rules]. If you have any queries or questions,
feel free to raise an issue and one of the organisers will be able to assist.

## Projects FAQs

### Can we work on our idea beforehand?

No. You are not allowed to start any development or design work on your project
before the event. This includes code, graphics, sounds and 3D designs. However,
you can research any ideas and concepts before the competition begins.

### Can we work on existing projects?

No, you will not be allowed to work on existing projects at UNIHACK. We want to
see new ideas that you and your team can come up with in allocated time.

You can use your own projects in your idea if it is open sourced.

### Does our idea have to follow a particular theme?

No, you are free to work on any idea that you like.

Some minor or sponsored prizes, however, may require you to follow a particular
theme or subject matter. However, competing for those prizes are optional.
