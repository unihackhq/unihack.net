      <h2>Who are we</h2>
      <h3><i>We are Australia's largest and premier student hackathon - run for students, by students.</i></h3>
      <p>
        Inspired by the student hackathons in the United States and Europe,
        UNIHACK was created in 2014 by WIRED Monash.
        Since then, UNIHACK has quickly become one of the go-to hackathons for university and TAFE students nationwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams have 24 hours to design and build something awesome.
        It can be anything - a website, a mobile application, a video game, or even something hardware.
        The important thing is that it needs to work when it is presented to the judges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are an avid programmer or a first-time hacker, UNIHACK welcomes everyone, regardless of skill level.
        You will have the opportunity to build, collaborate and learn from your fellow hackers and mentors at the event.
        The event will also have a number of quick tech talks throughout to help participants learn new or extend their existing skills.
