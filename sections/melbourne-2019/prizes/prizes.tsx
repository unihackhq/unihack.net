                Is the hack usable in its current state? Does it work as the
                creators say? Is the user experience smooth? Is it well designed
                for the target audience? Our judges will want to see and use
                your prototype - so make sure it works!

                Is the hack technically interesting or difficult? Is it just
                some lipstick on an API, or were there any technical challenges
                to surmount when building it?

                Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/web/IoT
                solution? Does it do something entirely novel, or at least take
                a fresh approach to an old problem?

                Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfil a real
                need that the community, the broader society or the target
                audience has? You do not need to prepare a business plan, but
                you should at least identify who is your target audience.
