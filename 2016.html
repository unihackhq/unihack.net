      <h3><span>About Us</span></h3>
      <p class="intro">
        We are Melbourne's premier student hackathon - run for students, by students from
        WIRED Monash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams have 24 hours to design and build something awesome. It can be anything -
        a website, a mobile application, a video game, or even something hardware. The
        important thing is that it needs to work when it is presented to the judges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are an avid programmer or a first-time hacker, UNIHACK welcomes
        everyone, regardless of skill level. You will have the opportunity to build,
        collaborate and learn from your fellow hackers and mentors at the event. The
        event will also have a number of tech talks throughout to help participants
        learn new or extend their existing skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        UNIHACK is organised by WIRED Monash, the IT student society at Monash
        University Clayton.
