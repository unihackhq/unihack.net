        <h3><span>Who are we?</span></h3>
        <p class="intro">
          We are Australia's largest and premier student hackathon - run for students, by students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by the student hackathons in the United States and Europe, UNIHACK was created in 2014 by WIRED Monash.
          Since then, UNIHACK has quickly become one of the go-to hackathons for university and TAFE students nationwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teams have 24 hours to design and build something awesome. It can be anything - a website, a mobile application,
          a video game, or even something hardware. The important thing is that it needs to work when it is presented
          to the judges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you are an avid programmer or a first-time hacker, UNIHACK welcomes everyone, regardless of skill level.
          You will have the opportunity to build, collaborate and learn from your fellow hackers and mentors at the event.
          The event will also have a number of quick tech talks throughout to help participants learn new or extend their
          existing skills.

        <p>
          The organisers of UNIHACK are committed in increasing the diversity of UNIHACK competitors. We
          will be collaborating with Women in ICT and Engineering groups across Australia to help promote
          the event. We will also collaborate with ICT and Engineering groups that represent LGBT students
          to ensure they are also represented at UNIHACK.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also committed in producing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
          gender, age, sexual orientation, disability and religion. All persons involved in UNIHACK are
          required to comply with the terms set out in the Hack Code of Conduct this year &mdash; including
          attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff.
